          Hey! It's so good to have you, my name is Gabriel Sitorus. I am a
          business grad turned software engineer. Upon my graduation from
          Chapman University, the world was at the peak of COVID, which had made
          applying to jobs a little bit more difficult, especially because I was
          an international student living in the Unites States at the time. So
          instead of putting all my efforts into pursuing a path in business, I
          began to explore other paths and opportunities.
          <br />
          <br />
          Coding stuck out to me because not only that I figured that with this
          new skill I would able to code open new doors., but I understood that
          although I can make a great impact through business, for me to create
          the vehicle that will push for a better tomorrow, I NEEDED to be in
          tech.
          <br />
          <br />
          What you are looking at now; this portfolio, as well a few of the
          projects linked below are representations of what I have learnt so far
          as a software engineer, and I would love, if given the opportunity, to
          continue this growth together.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cheers üëãüèΩ
